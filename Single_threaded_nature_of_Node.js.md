The phrase “Single-threaded nature of Node.js causing request queues” means:
> Node.js handles all incoming requests using a single main thread, so when a request takes too long (e.g., due to a slow database query or heavy computation), other incoming requests get queued up, waiting for their turn to be processed.

#### Node.js is single-threaded
* It runs on one thread (the event loop) for handling JavaScript code.
* It’s very fast at I/O operations (like reading files, database calls, API requests), because those are non-blocking and handled in the background by the OS or worker threads.

#### But there's a catch❗:
If you run a CPU-intensive or blocking operation (like a big loop, complex math, or waiting on a slow DB), the event loop gets blocked, and:
* Other requests can't be processed.
* They form a queue, leading to increased latency or even timeouts.

🧠 Example
Imagine this basic server:
```javascript
app.get('/slow', (req, res) => {
  // Simulating a blocking operation
  const start = Date.now();
  while (Date.now() - start < 5000) {} // 5 seconds block
  res.send("Done");
});
```
If one user hits /slow, everyone else must wait 5 seconds before their request is handled — because the event loop is blocked.

#### 🛠️ Solutions
1. Offload heavy work
> Move CPU-heavy tasks to worker threads or a separate service.
> Example: worker_threads module in Node.js.

2. Use asynchronous non-blocking code
> Avoid while loops, blocking file reads, or synchronous DB queries.
> Use async/await, Promises, or callbacks properly.

3. Cluster mode
> Run multiple Node.js processes across CPU cores using cluster or tools like PM2.
> Each process gets its own event loop.

4. Offload background tasks
> Use message queues (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) to handle things like sending emails or image processing outside the request cycle.

5. Use a load balancer
> Distribute traffic between multiple instances of your Node.js app using something like NGINX, HAProxy, or AWS ELB.

🔚 In short:
> Node.js is fast as long as you don’t block the event loop. If you do, other requests wait in line, creating a `request queue.`
