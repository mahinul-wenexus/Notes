## Python
* Great for both simple and complex projects
* Works well with AI and data analysis
* Not great for mobile apps
* Can get messy in very large projects

##### Python's execution is slower
Python is known for its simplicity and readability, but it is not the fastest programming language in terms of raw execution speed. Many other languages are significantly faster due to being compiled, closer to the hardware, or optimized for performance.
Here‚Äôs a list of languages that are generally faster than Python, with a brief explanation:

#### üî∫ Compiled Languages (Much Faster Than Python)
| Language        | Reason for Speed                                                                                                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C**           | Very low-level, minimal abstraction, directly compiled to machine code.                                         |
| **C++**         | Similar to C, but with object-oriented features; can be just as fast.                                           |
| **Rust**        | Modern systems language with safety guarantees and performance similar to C++.                                  |
| **Go (Golang)** | Compiled, designed for concurrency and speed with simplicity.                                                   |
| **Java**        | Compiled to bytecode and run on JVM with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Faster than Python in most benchmarks. |
| **Swift**       | Compiled language optimized for performance on Apple platforms.                                                 |
| **Fortran**     | Especially fast in numerical computation, used in scientific computing.                                         |


#### ‚ö° JIT-Compiled Languages (Still Faster Than Python)
According to [The Computer Language Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/), in terms of speed:

| Language        | Relative Speed (compared to Python) |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| C               | \~50‚Äì100x faster                    |
| Rust            | \~50‚Äì100x faster                    |
| Go              | \~10‚Äì40x faster                     |
| Java            | \~10‚Äì30x faster                     |
| Julia           | \~10‚Äì50x faster                     |
| JavaScript (V8) | \~5‚Äì20x faster                      |
| C++             | \~50‚Äì100x faster                    |



### üîç Why Python is Slower
* Interpreted: Python code is not compiled to machine code.
* Dynamic Typing: Adds runtime overhead.
* `Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)`: Prevents true multi-threading in CPython.
* Memory Management: Garbage collection introduces latency.


##### Javascript is also interpreted. Why Javascript is faster?
##### ‚úÖ Why JavaScript Can Be Much Faster Than Python (Despite Being Interpreted)
Modern JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome and Node.js) use `Just-In-Time (JIT)` Compilation, which gives JavaScript a significant speed advantage over standard `interpreted Python (CPython)`.

### üîç Key Differences: JavaScript vs Python Execution
| Feature                  | JavaScript (V8, etc.)                                                             | Python (CPython)                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compilation**          | JIT-compiled (hot code is compiled at runtime to machine code)                    | Purely interpreted (CPython runs bytecode in a virtual machine) |
| **Runtime Optimization** | Advanced techniques like inline caching, hidden classes, speculative optimization | Minimal runtime optimization                                    |
| **Engine**               | Highly optimized engines (V8, SpiderMonkey)                                       | CPython is not optimized for speed                              |
| **Concurrency**          | Event loop and non-blocking async I/O                                             | Threaded but restricted by GIL                                  |
| **Garbage Collection**   | Highly optimized generational GC                                                  | Slower GC, more latency-sensitive                               |


* JavaScript code starts as interpreted.
* Frequently run code is hot and gets JIT-compiled to machine code.
* Inline functions, optimized memory access, and fast property lookups speed things up.

### üî• Result:
JavaScript can outperform Python by 5x‚Äì20x in raw speed benchmarks, especially in tight loops, math operations, or async I/O.
